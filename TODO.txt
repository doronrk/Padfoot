  1 per instrument, each note gets a reference and applies gain to sum of all voices
Different sustain modes
Waveform zooming
Mapping each note to multiple voices:
  octaves
  panned left and right
  detuning
  possible first pass, 3 params: 
    1) num octaves above root 
    2) detune each octave, 2 voices per octave 
    3) stereo factor, 0 is both voices per octave down the middle, 1.0 is hard pan
    * then introduce fanciness as needed but don't expose to user
      ** like "blend factor" don't have all down-tuned voices panned left, 
         octave zero downtuned goes right, octave one downtuned goes left, etc.
