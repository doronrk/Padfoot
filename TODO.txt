TODO:
  first try making value tree state changes synchronous and see if that's sufficient,
    the SampleLoop can be a listener, and bound the value on the callback


MUST HAVE:

crossfade near edges of sample loop
Mapping each note to multiple voices:
  octaves
  panned left and right
  detuning
  possible first pass, 3 params: 
    1) num octaves above root 
    2) detune each octave, 2 voices per octave 
    3) stereo factor, 0 is both voices per octave down the middle, 1.0 is hard pan
    * then introduce fanciness as needed but don't expose to user
      ** like "blend factor" don't have all down-tuned voices panned left, 
         octave zero downtuned goes right, octave one downtuned goes left, etc.
ASDR
  1 per instrument, each note gets a reference and applies gain to sum of all voices
File drag and drop
Adjustable polyphony
  option to have multiple notes of same midi note number w/o retriggering 
  recycle active note policy
  handle the case where user lowers polyphony to less than current num active notes


NICE TO HAVE:

Waveform zooming
expose attenuation of different octaves (through drawing a curve or something)
Adjust midi root note
Padfoot sample export by dragging some handle into DAW
  have a background thread render this as soon as parameters stay unchanged for at least 1 second or something
  related: recycle feature that just does this to the sample in place



BONUS FEATURE:

support "sync sample" style looping
Support for major & minor samples depending on key
